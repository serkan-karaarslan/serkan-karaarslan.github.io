            <p>
              Users' expectation and needs are constantly changing. If your business can't compete with the speed, you will be replaced by others who can move fast. 
              There are 5 simple characteristics for evolutionary architecture. Spoiler alert; not all aspects are technical.

              It brings business and IT people together to discuss and grasp topics with the same language. 
              As architect, you clearly see bounded context, relations between them and accordingly design solution within modular way 
              to support evolutionary architecture.

            <p>
            API is like a gossip when it's out it's forever. Building a RESTful API takes around 15 minutes. 
            You need have a plan to guide each team about their API journey with guidelines to keep quality of each API in an acceptable level.
